I recently watched the movie, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, that is in the perspective of a journalist with Locked-in Syndrome. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly is based on a true story and is an adaptation of a book written by Jean-Dominique Bauby himself. Bauby, a patient with Locked-in Syndrome, managed to write the book by blinking his eyes. You can read more about the movie and book here. 

<h3>How did Bauby Communicate?</h3>
In the movie, his determined speech therapist develops a system of French letters in order of frequency. She reads the letters in the sequence while observing his eye movements. Bauby blinks once when she stops at his letter. When she asks him a question, he blinks once for "yes" and twice for "no." 

<h3>His Feelings</h3> 
Bauby is quite frustrated with the system. The people who try to help him communicate read the letters too fast, too slow, or forget to make eye contact with him. In general, he feels burdened by such a system of communication.

<h3>Connection to My Product</h3>
My emoticon keyboard will make it significantly easier to communicate as the patient is no longer dependent on another individual. Emoticons will cross cultural and language barriers, and one icon will be sufficient to convey a message. In other words, the patient will not have to select each letter of the word "W A T E R", but instead will be able to select a water icon that may be represented with a water droplet, for example.
