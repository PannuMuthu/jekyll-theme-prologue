<h3>Locked into Your Body</h3>
Initially, I had intended the product to be used for patients with Locked-in Syndrome (LiS), which is a condition that results from damage to the brainstem. Individuals with LiS are unable to move or speak, but are fully aware and conscious of their surroundings. In other words, they are able to "blink" and "think." My emoticon keyboard will allow patients with LiS to communicate easily and effectively, taking away the frustration that patients may experience in the current system.

<h3>Across the medical field</h3>
In many cases, patients are unable to communicate with their physicians and caregivers. For instance, those in the intensive care unit are often connected to devices or are in a situation in which it is not possible to speak. Even patients in emergency care may be in a similar situation.

As of now, communication boards are utilized for patients with conditions like autism. Based on a conversation I had with an individual who works with autistic children, current communication boards can be confusing. Children may point to icons randomly, which makes it difficult to come to a conclusion.
