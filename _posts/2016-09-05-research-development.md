I am currently conducting research at a Brain-Computer Interface Lab to enhance the communication board.

My objectives: 
To compare the effectiveness of modern picture communication boards and proposed emoji communication boards
To determine the most frequently used expressions of patients with LiS, ALS, and patients in the ICU
To develop a mock communication board as a prototype for an electronic communication board 
To develop an electronic communication board that incorporates BCI technology
