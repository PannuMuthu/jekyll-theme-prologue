I am currently conducting research at a Brain-Computer Interface Lab to enhance the communication board.

My objectives: 
 1. To compare the effectiveness of modern picture communication boards and proposed emoji communication boards
 2. To determine the most frequently used expressions of patients with LiS, ALS, and patients in the ICU
 3. To develop a mock communication board as a prototype for an electronic communication board 
 4. To develop an electronic communication board that incorporates BCI technology
