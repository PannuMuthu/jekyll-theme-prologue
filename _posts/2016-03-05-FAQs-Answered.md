<h3>How did you come up with your idea?</h3>
My first time learning about a situation where patients are locked into their own bodies, I was devastated. Imagine how it would feel to be unable to convey your thoughts and feelings. Interestingly enough, while thinking about a solution, I was toying around with my phone until I came across the set of emojis. 

<h3>Did your previous interests or background factor into this project?</h3>
I have been interested in neuroscience for multiple years now, which is how I learned about Locked-in Syndrome. Last summer, I learned more about the latest technology in medicine and the future direction of the field. My passion in both medicine and neuroscience has had an influence on my idea. 

<h3>How does your product work?</h3>
My product idea is an a communication board with a complementary headset. Several hospitals and organizations expressed interested in my product while I presented at the medical conference. Many people encouraged me to extend the uses of the product to patients in intensive care and emergency care. Children with disabilities will also benefit from this project.

<h3>How are you developing it?</h3>
Currently, I am contacting various companies that specialize in each of the major aspects of the product: EEG/Brain-Computer Interface and eye tracking. In addition, I am conducting research on the viability of emojis as a universal language. At a Brain-Computer Interface lab, I am testing the screens and functionality of the communication board.
